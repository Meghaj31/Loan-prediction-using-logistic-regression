# Loan-prediction-using-logistic-regression
This project is a part of my Code Clause Internship as a data science intern

In this project, we have used a banking dataset consisting of csv files

Our aim is to predict if the loan is gonna approved by the bank or not based on various features from the dataset

We have achieved the following in this project:

-> Observing the dataset and finding patterns

-> Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values

-> Implementation of Logistic Regression


We achieved the following results:

Accuracy = 0.861

F1_score = 0.908
